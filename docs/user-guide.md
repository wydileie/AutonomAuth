# AutonomAuth User Guide

## Introduction

AutonomAuth is a decentralized authentication system that gives you full control over your identity and authentication data. Your data is stored securely on the Autonomi network, not on centralized servers, ensuring privacy and security.

This guide will help you understand how to use AutonomAuth for authentication across multiple websites and services.

## Getting Started

### Download the Mobile App

1. Download the AutonomAuth mobile app from the [App Store](#) (iOS) or [Google Play](#) (Android).
2. Install the app on your device.

### Create Your Identity

1. Open the AutonomAuth app.
2. Tap "Create New Identity".
3. Follow the prompts to create your master key - this will be the foundation of your digital identity.
4. Write down your recovery phrase in a safe, offline location. This is critical for recovering your identity if you lose your device.
5. Set up a PIN or use your device's biometric authentication (fingerprint/face recognition) to secure the app.

### Create Your First Profile

1. Once your identity is created, you'll be prompted to create a profile.
2. Enter a name for your profile (e.g., "Personal", "Work", "Social Media").
3. Optionally, add a profile picture.

You can create multiple profiles for different purposes. Each profile acts as a separate identity that you can use for different services.
